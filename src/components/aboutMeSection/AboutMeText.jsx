      <p>
        Iâ€™m Aminu Goni Bukar, a First-Class graduate of Software Engineering, web development instructor,
        and passionate full-stack engineer focused on building inclusive, impactful, and user-driven solutions.
        With strong proficiency in React, Python, PHP, and MySQL, I design and develop real-world systems that enhance accessibility, 
        automate workflows, and address challenges across sectors like education, finance, and health tech.
        I currently serve as a Software Engineer at KAEDCO, where I led the full development of an internal ICT Welfare Loan Application system that
        streamlined staff financing operations. I also spearheaded the creation of an assistive voice-activated system for the visually impaired, 
        a project that reflects my deep commitment to inclusive technology and human-centered design.
